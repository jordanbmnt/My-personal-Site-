        I am very interested in learning and getting accustomed to things. Since I was little I would always find myself looking for something new to learn, eventually, I found my way to technology.
        For me, it started with my mother's laptop. It was always such an interesting experience to explore the laptop. I did my utmost best to always try and explore its many features. This might have led to me crashing the laptop a few times <img src="./images/broke.png" alt="woops" class="extraParagraphPic"> <br> but even though I crashed it I always came back. <br>
        Eventually, life took its toll ( I didnâ€™t die obviously) but slowly the fire, rather the thirst for knowledge simmered down. Until matric came. Matric was aâ€¦ well it depends which part of matric we are talking about. The friends, the experiences, or the marks. Matric was interesting because this was where the fire started again, but it didnâ€™t start consciously. I heard a quote and instantly, two parts just connected and the<a href="https://youtu.be/eFTLKWw542g" target="blank" id="ðŸ”¥">fire was lit once again.</a> <br>
        From there I pursued the answer to every question I had at the time. And Yoh! I must say I enjoyed learning, understanding, and applying this newfound knowledge. <img class="extraParagraphPic" src="./images/happy.png" alt="excited"> <br>
        One thing lead to the next, I did a few career tests and at that point, I knew I wanted to study the brain. (That didnâ€™t end up happening).
        Now looking back I see why it wouldnâ€™t have worked out. Theory with no practical work for more than two years wouldâ€™ve killed me.
        So I took a second approach. IT?
        At the time I just jumped into it but quickly gained a newfound interest in it. It became one of my favorite things to learn about. Slowly slowly I became more familiar and eventually came to love coding and programming.

        Based on my current knowledge, I see myself continuing in web development and eventually venturing into more intense languages. I plan on working overseas after some time here in SA. My reason for this is to gain new experiences and learn new things.
